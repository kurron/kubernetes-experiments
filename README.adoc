== Overview
This project contains smaller sub-projects that I've used to learn how to work with Kubernetes.  The services I've typically run as Docker containers have been converted to K8s.

== Prerequisites
* multiple servers running Ubuntu 20.04
* https://microk8s.io/[MicroK8s] installed on each server via Ubuntu Installer

== Building

== Installation
One of the servers will be used as the master and the remaining servers will be worker nodes.  Follow https://microk8s.io/docs/clustering[Multi-node MicroK8s] instructions to add worker nodes.

== Tips and Tricks
=== Alias kubectl
Aliasing `microk8s.kubectl` to `kubectl` shortens the commands a bit and all instructions will use `kubectl`. 

== Troubleshooting
